A portfolio and resume [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org) theme with minimalist design principles. The theme is clean, content-focused, and designed for clarity. It offers simple, straight forward typography readable on a wide variety of screen sizes, and suitable for multiple languages. It is designed using a mobile-first approach, meaning your content takes center-stage, regardless of whether your visitors arrive by smartphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop computer.
